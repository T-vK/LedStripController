# LedStripController
RGB LED Strip controller using BS170 MOSFETs and an Arduino

## What you need
* An Arduino
* 3x BS170 MOSFET
* An RGB LED strip
* A power source that can deliver enough amps for the LED strip 

## The circuit of the controller

(It doesn't have to be a 3.7V LiPo or a special LED strip.)
A 12V LED strip with a 12V power source should work just the same.
